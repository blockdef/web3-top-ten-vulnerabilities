title: Reentrancy Attack
---

## Description

A reentrancy attack is a type of vulnerability in smart contracts where a malicious contract can repeatedly call back into the vulnerable contract before the original function call completes, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or loss of funds.

## Summary

Reentrancy attacks exploit the order of operations in smart contracts to manipulate state changes and drain funds from vulnerable contracts. This vulnerability arises when a contract interacts with untrusted external contracts before completing its internal state changes.

## Real-World Examples

The most infamous example of a reentrancy attack is the DAO hack in 2016, where an attacker exploited a reentrancy vulnerability to drain Ether from the DAO contract.

## Code Example

```javascript
contract Vulnerable {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    function withdraw(uint256 _amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount);
        balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: _amount}("");
        require(success);
    }
}

## Prevention Measures

Preventing reentrancy attacks involves using the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern, where external calls are made after modifying the contract's state. Additionally, developers should use the "withdraw pattern" for transferring funds and avoid using the transfer() or send() functions.
