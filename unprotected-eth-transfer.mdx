# Unprotected Ethereum Transfer Vulnerability

## Overview

The Unprotected Ethereum Transfer Vulnerability is a common security issue in smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. This vulnerability occurs when a contract transfers Ether to an address without proper access control or authentication mechanisms in place. 

## Explanation

When a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain facilitates the transfer of Ether to another address, it must ensure that only authorized users or entities can initiate such transfers. Without proper access control, malicious actors may exploit the contract's functionality to drain funds from it.

## Example

Consider the following simplified example of a vulnerable smart contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract VulnerableContract {
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function transferEther(address payable _recipient, uint256 _amount) external {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can transfer Ether");
        _recipient.transfer(_amount);
    }
}
