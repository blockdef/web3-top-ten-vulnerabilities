title: Integer Overflow Attack
---

## Description

An integer overflow attack is a type of vulnerability in smart contracts where arithmetic operations on integers can result in unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities when the result exceeds the maximum representable value for that data type.

## Summary

Integer overflow attacks occur when the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in the data type. Attackers exploit this vulnerability to manipulate smart contract behavior, often resulting in loss of funds or unintended consequences.

## Real-World Examples

One notable example of an integer overflow attack is the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) hack in 2016, where an attacker exploited an integer overflow vulnerability in a smart contract to siphon off millions of dollars worth of Ether.

## Code Example

```javascript
contract IntegerOverflow {
    uint256 public balance = 100;

    function addToBalance(uint256 _addition) public {
        balance += _addition; // Vulnerable to integer overflow
    }
}

## Prevention Measures

To prevent integer overflow attacks, developers should use safe arithmetic libraries, perform bounds checking, and use data types with fixed sizes. Additionally, using libraries such as SafeMath in Solidity can help mitigate this vulnerability.
